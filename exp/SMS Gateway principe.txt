modem gsm/cdma regexp parser

1. First turn off command echo to avoid wrong response (ATE0), disable quiet result mode (ATQ0), verbose result codes (ATV1)
2. reponse are: AT command response; and Network Notification
3. AT command response only found after AT command response with final result OK|ERROR|...
4. Network notification response can found anytime
5. please consider, network notification response can be found before AT command response, 
   due to there is a time from 1st character of AT command sent to last character and execute that AT command.
6. the safest method is, always wait AT command response before send the another AT command.
7. there'is a case:  PC <--> Modem <--> Network
   T | (PC -> Modem) | (Network -> Modem) | (Modem -> PC)
   0   AT                                 
   1   +CMGL           +CDS: ...
   2   ="ALL"                
   3   <CR>
   4                                        +CDS:                                        
   5                   +CMTI:...            (AT-command response)
   6                                        +CMTI:
   7
there'r the explanation:
0. at T-0 to T-3, PC sent AT command to modem
1. at T-1, modem receive +CDS network notification and then fill the 'modem->pc' buffer (not shown)
2. at T-3, modem execute AT+CMGL command
3. at T-4 to T-6, PC request (not shown) to modem for receiving modem->pc buffer 
4. at T-5, modem receive another +CMTI notification and then fill the 'modem->pc' buffer (not shown)
5. so, the received buffer are:
   1- +CDS
   2- (AT-command response)
   3- +CMTI
Of coure the AT-command response is the last executed AT command, that is AT+CMGL response.
How to pharse them? Every response is pre & post-fix with <CR><LF> (\r\n).
For AT-command response, the result are specified at-command respons and followed with the final result.
The AT-command final result are ERROR or OK or other final result that depend on
type of modem. For example if AT+CMEE=1 then another final result is +CME.
Of course again, Network notification response don't have final result.
Refer to your modem's manual for specified response format. This will help you how to read them.

Regular Expression:
before, response, after = .scan(/(.*?)\r\n(OK|ERROR|\+.*?)(\r\n.*)/im)[0]
.scan(/(.*)\r\n(OK.*?|(\+CM.\s)?ERROR.*?)(\r\n.*)/im)

.scan(/(.*?)\r\n((OK)\s?(.*?)|(ERROR)\s?(.*?)|(\+|\~|\!|\&)((.*?)(\:\s?(.*?))?))(\r\n.*)/im)


Replaced Result Code:
AT+CRC  RING change +CRING
AT+CMEE ERROR add +CME +CMS
